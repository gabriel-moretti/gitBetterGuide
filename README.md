# Git Better Guide
This project aims to conduct research and develop guidelines for creating, maintaining, and documenting projects in order to improve effectiveness and clarity. The goal is to improve communication among team members by emphasizing the proper use of commits and documents. By implementing these guidelines, teams can streamline their workflows and enhance collaboration.

As I embark on my career journey, I find myself deeply passionate about research and excited to coordinate a team. However, I've been encountering challenges when it comes to repository documentation, which is impacting our team's collaboration. I am determined to find a clever and beautiful solution to improve this aspect.

To start off, I believe it's crucial to establish a clear vision and purpose for our project documentation. Defining our objectives, goals, and desired outcomes will lay a strong foundation for our team and guide our research efforts.

First and foremost, I will develop a comprehensive documentation strategy that outlines the best approach for most projects for web. This strategy will encompass various document types, such as project plans, requirements specifications, design documents and user manuals. Striking the right balance between detail and conciseness will be a priority.

I will also create standardized templates for our project documents, ensuring consistency across the board. These templates will serve as a framework, making it easier for our team members to contribute effectively to the documentation process.
